# Paint-and-Calculator
Paint and Calculator [Java]
Task given on the laboratories, which I have extended a bit.
1. Simple paint, with shape painting possibilities
2. I was curious about good calc implementations, so it's just the presentation of lib I've used
3. My own calc implementation, string based (quite similar to windows standard calc)
Browse the .png'ies ;).
